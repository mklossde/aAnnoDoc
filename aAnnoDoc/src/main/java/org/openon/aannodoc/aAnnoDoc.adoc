 * (If you like aAnnoDoc please donate via paypal to openonorg. Every $1-$nnn is welcome. )
 * 
 * Normaly documenation and devleopment are two seperated parts
 * and it is time and coast intensive to write one after each other. 
 * 
 * A good idea is two sync the development and documenation process,
 * by put the information near by the source code. 
 * 
 * This is the base idea of AnnoDoc-Project to add application documenation
 * (like dsciption, bugs, features, examples, atrriubtes,...) to (or near to) 
 * the source code and generate the documenation during 
 * compile-process (or maven deploy process). 
 * 
 * IT IS NOT ANOTHER JAVA-API-DOCUMENATION ! 
 * The idea is write application information (like Manuals, installtion-guids, ReadMes, AsiccDoc,.. )  
 * inside the project. 
 * 
 * The document-generation is splitted into two parts
 * - scanner: SourceCode or JAR scanner/reader which read all the project informations 
 * - generator: generates the structure/documents into a readable format (like AsciiDoc,PDF,HTML,.. )  
 * 
 * The important part are the gernerator, which are individual programmable to 
 * generate individual documents. There are some base generators included
 * to create a Application-Manual, a Annotation-Overview,... 
 * 
 * To work with AnnoDoc use one of this ways
 * - add the aAnnoDocMavenPlugin to generate documents during deployment
 * - call org.openon.aannodoc.AnnoDoc from console
 * - program a AnnoDoc Process manual 
 * 
 * The Scanner scans all java-sources and use comments for documenation. 
 * Simple: 
 * 		- The comment above belong to the annotation/method below. 
 * 		- Test/comment-annotations belong to the text right until next \@ 
 * 		- Inline-comments are ignored !!! 
 *
